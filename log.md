# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2016
Today's Progress: Started A program that will convert my text checklist and convert them to HTML

Thoughts: It feels good sometimes to program something that doesn't require a lot of new tech

### Day 1: Jan 3, 2016
Today's Progress: Added checkbox's for todo items.

Thoughts: I spent to much time trying to figure out how checkboxes worked in react using my redux state. I should have looked it up earlier
