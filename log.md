Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: The best way to describe what I was doing today is play. I spent a lot of time refactoring and changing this just to see how they worked.

### Day 4: Jan 6, 2016
Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: I find refactoring helps me understand the relationships going on in my code and helps me better understand the options I have when coding.

### Day 3: Jan 5, 2016
Today's Progress: Added working filters to my todo list

Thoughts: There is a handful of stuff that was really ugly code today. I'm tempted to refactor but this really small project was only meant to test out Redux and get a feel so I'm not sure its important.

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2016
Today's Progress: Started A program that will convert my text checklist and convert them to HTML

Thoughts: It feels good sometimes to program something that doesn't require a lot of new tech

### Day 1: Jan 3, 2016
Today's Progress: Added check box's for todo items.

Thoughts: I spent to much time trying to figure out how checkboxes worked in react using my Redux state. I should have looked it up earlier
