# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 14: Jan 16, 2017
Today's Progress: Changed the create poll interface to add and remove input fields. Also fixed a bunch of warnings.

Thoughts: I have tones of warnings in my code. I think I need to check up with the warnings more often and clean things up.

### Day 13: Jan 15, 2017
Today's Progress: Added some small improvements on how the data presented from the RESTful API. Store is now updated to reflect the service records of charts for a user. User charts are also displayed

Thoughts: I would like to use "fetch" instead of JQuery ajax call. I feel the Redux solidifying itself in my head.

### Day 12: Jan 14, 2017
Today's Progress: Now able to use the front end to create the data for a chart in the RESTful service. GUI is plugged in.

Thoughts: Seems despite reading half a book I always at least get a small snag on CORS but this time around is wasn't bad. I had a lot of fun. I got more done and got to spend more time on programming today.

### Day 11: Jan 13, 2017
Today's Progress: Front end is now able to get a token via the backends RESTful service api.

Thoughts: It's cool getting a small glimpse of the applications 2 major parts starting to connect

### Day 10: Jan 12, 2017
Today's Progress: Added in some functional functions

Thoughts: I'm trying to take a functional approach to this problem and I think its going to be an interesting slightly uncomfortable situation since I'm used to OOP. I believe I'm going to enjoy this though.

### Day 9: Jan 11, 2017
Today's Progress: Worked on token login but no real progress

Thoughts: I feel like I failed today. I was stuck in an environment that was really distracting and started a lot of code that I just ended up deleting there was no commit. I found out my RESTFUL server at home was down so I switched to another project and didn't commit on that.

### Day 8: Jan 10, 2017
Today's Progress: Debugging tool and access to Redux store for a class.

Thoughts: I didn't make much progress today. I'm enjoying the process and trying to have just as much fun for days with little progress because they are bound to happen.

### Day 7: Jan 9, 2017
Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: I'm finished with my test todo list app! It feels good to be done. This project was pretty fun. I know in the rules this 100 days is not supposed to count tutorials in light of this I did not count watching time and I didn't follow the tutorial line by line just the gist.

### Day 6: Jan 8, 2017
Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: [Dan Abramov's Todo Lession](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree) is the best technical video lesson I have ever seen. The following reasons are why I think this lesson is amazing he goes in small testable steps, he does most things in 2-3 ways which helps for understanding, he implements his own version of some of the things your using and goes over key concepts like immutability and tips on how to implement it. I did find this tutorial more useful after already learning React but man what a way to learn Redux.

### Day 5: Jan 7, 2017
Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: The best way to describe what I was doing today is play. I spent a lot of time refactoring and changing this just to see how they worked.

### Day 4: Jan 6, 2017
Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: I find refactoring helps me understand the relationships going on in my code and helps me better understand the options I have when coding.

### Day 3: Jan 5, 2017
Today's Progress: Added working filters to my todo list

Thoughts: There is a handful of stuff that was really ugly code today. I'm tempted to refactor but this really small project was only meant to test out Redux and get a feel so I'm not sure its important.

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2017
Today's Progress: Started A program that will convert my text checklist and convert them to HTML

Thoughts: It feels good sometimes to program something that doesn't require a lot of new tech

### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017
Today's Progress: Added check box's for todo items.

Thoughts: I spent to much time trying to figure out how checkboxes worked in react using my Redux state. I should have looked it up earlier
