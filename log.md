### Day 55, Feb 26, 2017
Today's Progress: Fixed a foreign key constraint in the table making code in "Time Punch Service". Fixed issue on both projects where I uploaded the dev config to github (I'm going to delete the old dev password). Changed config file's to JSON format.

Thoughts: It was dumb of me to upload the database config even if the passwords getting changed. I need to be careful.

### Day 54, Feb 25, 2017
Today's Progress: Toke care of some import issues on the voting app. Fixed some issues on time-clock-service with the table setup code hanging up and potential ordering issues with table creation.

Thoughts: It was harder to make sure I made the time today but I got it.

### Day 48, Feb 19, 2017
Today's Progress: Improving on aesthetics mostly. I also was able to fix some code warnings.

Thoughts: I was really into it today. Flow state for a large chunk of the day.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 47, Feb 18, 2017
Today's Progress: Added the ability to add additional questions to poll after its created.

Thoughts: I'm excited for the next project when I get to try to do things better then this one.

### Day 46, Feb 17, 2017
Today's Progress: The home page now displays the latest polls. You can click on the chart to vote. I fixed some warnings.

Thoughts: Really getting close to finishing this app. I need to make it look nicer clean up some code and reread the assignment to make sure everything is done.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 45, Feb 16, 2017
Today's Progress: Added an API endpoint for getting the latest charts. Started to implement the means of accessing that API in the front end.

Thoughts: I'm getting more and more comfortable with the whole services and front end workflow.

### Day 44, Feb 15, 2017
Today's Progress: Fixed bugs where old chart does not show up before the new one loads. Now when you vote on something it forwards the user to a thanks page.

Thoughts: I feel my brain is on top of things more in the morning then at night.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 43, Feb 14, 2017
Today's Progress: Fixed a bug where an old chart would display instead of the current one.

Thoughts: Alter components with a jquery type code after its already rendered feels really dirty and looks messing. I'm not a big fan but I think that's just how d3 js works.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 42, Feb 13, 2017
Today's Progress: Created a new api project that accepts a post request

Thoughts: I was struggling to get code down on my other project so just started this one to keep my fingers moving.

Link to work: [time-clock-service](https://github.com/MouseZero/time-clock-service)

### Day 41, Feb 12, 2017
Today's Progress: Added the ability to vote from the front end of the code.

Thoughts: I've got some bugs and really I should have been using redux thunk for async calls that effect the store.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 40, Feb 11, 2017
Today's Progress: I now have a vote endpoint in the back end

Thoughts: I think I like the backend a bit more then front end

Link to work: [Voting App Backend](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app-backend)

### Day 39, Feb 10, 2017
Today's Progress: Improvements on chart display for the front end. Some refactoring in the back-end to get ready for voting ability.

Thoughts: I get to switch gears to backend which I love.

### Day 38, Feb 9, 2017
Today's Progress: Added number of votes as well as labels on the chart.

Thoughts: I hit a rough spot today trying to figure out how the scalers worked. I think a lot of what was tripping me up is the fact that as you increase the Y value you do down instead of up.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 37, Feb 8, 2017
Today's Progress: Moved the chart to make room for text

Thoughts: Not feeling 100% but I still squeezed in time for my coding.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 36, Feb 7, 2017
Today's Progress: Scaling to the size of the screen happens even if you change the size of your window. Put in a bit of color.

Thoughts: I love that this is a habit and even if I put in the minimal amount of time and read for the rest of the day I feel like a accomplished something.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 35, Feb 6, 2017
Today's Progress: Chart now scales to the size of the screen.

Thoughts: This go around with d3 has been great. The first time I did D3 I disliked it but there was many functional concepts that I was learning and I think that contributed to my frustration back then.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 34, Feb 5, 2017
Today's Progress: removed react-d3-library and replacing it with real d3. I created a component with a extremely primitive bar chart with no labels

Thoughts: I had more fun this time. Creating the bar chart on my own feels less like cheating.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 33, Feb 4, 2017
Today's Progress: Added the ability to clock out. When clocking out the program does not record duration. I also did some re-factoring

Thoughts: still going strong

Link to work: [timeClock](https://github.com/MouseZero/timeClock.git)

### Day 32, Feb 3, 2017
Today's Progress: Time card now records the amount of time each clock item took. I used streams for this because I may have to use it at work in a bit.

Thoughts: I really enjoy sessions like this where there is enough challange but I still know enough about the problem to keep busy and not stop much. Before I started coding I did a good bit of reading in the docs about the streams and I think this helped a lot and there was less trial and error.

Link to work: [timeClock](https://github.com/MouseZero/timeClock.git)

### Day 31, Feb 2, 2017
Today's Progress: Created a small command line "time clock" app in a few hours.

Thoughts: This was fun to complete a small project so fast.

Link to work: [timeClock](https://github.com/MouseZero/timeClock.git)

### Day 30, Feb 1, 2017
Today's Progress: Bar charts are now being displayed for the polls. Some code warning fixes

Thoughts: Getting code in even if its just a little feels pretty productive.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 29: Jan 31, 2017
Today's Progress: Created a component for displaying Bar Charts

Thoughts: Things went reasonably smoothly for only spending an hour

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 28: Jan 30, 2017
Today's Progress: Drew a planet using CSS. Started a drawing of a planet using canvas.

Thoughts: This was kind of a fun deviation from the norm.

### Day 27: Jan 29, 2017
Today's Progress: I got a chart to show up in my react app.

Thoughts: The react-d3-library isn't something I would use for a serious project. It forces you to specify stuff I don't care about such as margin and doesn't seem to let me use a normal react function with props for some reason it seems like I need a class with state in order to do it. I straight up could not follow the docs and had to find an example. I'm not sure if this library saved me time at all. I would suppose if you have not done any d3 in the past through its worth it.

Link to work: [messing-with-d3](https://github.com/MouseZero/messing-with-d3.git)

### Day 26: Jan 28, 2017
Today's Progress: got d3 working in my React project but no chart yet.

Thoughts: Cutting things a bit short because I want to read up on Urbit. I have a feeling this will become my next project.

Link to work: [messing-with-d3](https://github.com/MouseZero/messing-with-d3.git)

### Day 25: Jan 27, 2017
Today's Progress: Got a new project started up with React

Thoughts: It took me a lot longer then I thought to just get a simple project started

Link to work: [messing-with-d3](https://github.com/MouseZero/messing-with-d3.git)

### Day 24: Jan 26, 2017
Today's Progress: Not much still trying to get D3 working in React. Not to much in the way of commits.

Thoughts: Still struggling though trying to get D3 to work with react.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 23: Jan 25, 2017
Today's Progress: Not much at all a small refactoring and writing a bunch of code that was wrong and didn't get commited

Thoughts: For having such an unproductive day I don't feel so bad. You win some and you loss some and thats how it is.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 22: Jan 24, 2017
Today's Progress: The site can now create new users. There was a bug fix in the backend where failed user creation would brake the database connection.

Thoughts: When fixing the bug I can tell that I didn't spend much time refactoring that code. I'm hoping when I implement test I also start refactoring more.

### Day 21: Jan 23, 2017
Today's Progress: User input is now sanitized for SQL injection.

Thoughts: I skimmed over the doc's when I first put all the SQL code in and didn't even look at the simple ways you could make your query to prevent SQL injection. This is a good argument for making sure you take non rushed time to read docs. So often there are very important things spelled out clearly if you just take the time to read them.

Link to work: [Voting App Backend](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app-backend)

### Day 20: Jan 22, 2017
Today's Progress: Users can now delete charts.

Thoughts: Things went pretty well but I didn't have as much time as I would like to on the project.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 19: Jan 21, 2017
Today's Progress: Bug fixes, redirecting the user when they log on or off. Allow users who are not logged in to view a poll.

Thoughts: Very productive day today. I'm loving this more and more every single day. It feels as if the completion of my voting app is in sight.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 18: Jan 20, 2017
Today's Progress: Fixed warnings and fixed the login system that broke

Thoughts: Feeling more comfortable day to day in the code

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 17: Jan 19, 2017
Today's Progress: Taking care of many code warnings.

Thoughts: I need to be cleaner about my code while I create it. I have tones of code warnings.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 16: Jan 18, 2017
Today's Progress: Moved some of my code to adapt to the JWT living in the localStorage instead of the Redux Store

Thoughts: I think I broke something and I'm not able to log on. I'm sure testing would have prevented this.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 15: Jan 17, 2017
Today's Progress: Started on the page for desplaying polls. Login button changes to a profile button when you are logged in. You can now log out of the app.

Thoughts: I'm starting to get quicker at the typical Redux and React stuff.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 14: Jan 16, 2017
Today's Progress: Changed the create poll interface to add and remove input fields. Also fixed a bunch of warnings.

Thoughts: I have tones of warnings in my code. I think I need to check up with the warnings more often and clean things up.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 13: Jan 15, 2017
Today's Progress: Added some small improvements on how the data presented from the RESTful API. Store is now updated to reflect the service records of charts for a user. User charts are also displayed

Thoughts: I would like to use "fetch" instead of JQuery ajax call. I feel the Redux solidifying itself in my head.

### Day 12: Jan 14, 2017
Today's Progress: Now able to use the front end to create the data for a chart in the RESTful service. GUI is plugged in.

Thoughts: Seems despite reading half a book I always at least get a small snag on CORS but this time around is wasn't bad. I had a lot of fun. I got more done and got to spend more time on programming today.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 11: Jan 13, 2017
Today's Progress: Front end is now able to get a token via the backends RESTful service api.

Thoughts: It's cool getting a small glimpse of the applications 2 major parts starting to connect

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 10: Jan 12, 2017
Today's Progress: Added in some functional functions

Thoughts: I'm trying to take a functional approach to this problem and I think its going to be an interesting slightly uncomfortable situation since I'm used to OOP. I believe I'm going to enjoy this though.

### Day 9: Jan 11, 2017
Today's Progress: Worked on token login but no real progress

Thoughts: I feel like I failed today. I was stuck in an environment that was really distracting and started a lot of code that I just ended up deleting there was no commit. I found out my RESTFUL server at home was down so I switched to another project and didn't commit on that.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 8: Jan 10, 2017
Today's Progress: Debugging tool and access to Redux store for a class.

Thoughts: I didn't make much progress today. I'm enjoying the process and trying to have just as much fun for days with little progress because they are bound to happen.

Link to work: [Voting App](https://github.com/MouseZero/voting-app)

### Day 7: Jan 9, 2017
Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: I'm finished with my test todo list app! It feels good to be done. This project was pretty fun. I know in the rules this 100 days is not supposed to count tutorials in light of this I did not count watching time and I didn't follow the tutorial line by line just the gist.

Link to work: [React/Redux Todo App](https://github.com/MouseZero/redux-todo)

### Day 6: Jan 8, 2017
Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: [Dan Abramov's Todo Lession](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree) is the best technical video lesson I have ever seen. The following reasons are why I think this lesson is amazing he goes in small testable steps, he does most things in 2-3 ways which helps for understanding, he implements his own version of some of the things your using and goes over key concepts like immutability and tips on how to implement it. I did find this tutorial more useful after already learning React but man what a way to learn Redux.

### Day 5: Jan 7, 2017
Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: The best way to describe what I was doing today is play. I spent a lot of time refactoring and changing this just to see how they worked.

Link to work: [React/Redux Todo App](https://github.com/MouseZero/redux-todo)

### Day 4: Jan 6, 2017
Today's Progress: Refactoring

Thoughts: I find refactoring helps me understand the relationships going on in my code and helps me better understand the options I have when coding.

Link to work: [React/Redux Todo App](https://github.com/MouseZero/redux-todo)

### Day 3: Jan 5, 2017
Today's Progress: Added working filters to my todo list

Thoughts: There is a handful of stuff that was really ugly code today. I'm tempted to refactor but this really small project was only meant to test out Redux and get a feel so I'm not sure its important.

Link to work: [React/Redux Todo App](https://github.com/MouseZero/redux-todo)

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2017
Today's Progress: Started A program that will convert my text checklist and convert them to HTML

Thoughts: It feels good sometimes to program something that doesn't require a lot of new tech

Link to work: [text-todo-reformater](https://github.com/MouseZero/text-todo-reformater)


### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017
Today's Progress: Added check box's for todo items.

Thoughts: I spent to much time trying to figure out how checkboxes worked in react using my Redux state. I should have looked it up earlier
